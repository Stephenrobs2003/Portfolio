                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello, my name is Stephen Robert. I am a Research Assistant with a strong foundation in data integration and model parameterization, particularly within scientific applications. My recent experience at the Centre for Applied Mathematics at the University of St. Thomas has honed my skills in developing computational pipelines using Python, integrating extensive genetic sequencing data, and applying statistical evaluations to improve evolutionary biology models.</p>
                <p>I hold a Bachelor of Science in Data Science from the University of St. Thomas, where I also served as a Statistics Tutor, IT Hardware & Software Support Intern, and Resident Advisor. These roles have equipped me with a diverse skill set, including proficiency in programming languages such as Java, Python, R, and SQL, as well as tools like Tableau, PowerBI, and Oracle.</p>
                <p>During my internship at Koru Greens, I analyzed multiple datasets and created a Power BI dashboard that significantly enhanced the marketing team's performance efficiency. My ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams and develop data prototypes has been instrumental in driving business growth.</p>
                <p>I am eager to leverage my computational and data analytical skills as an Associate Data Engineer, contributing to data product development and insights delivery.

                        <h3>Computational Pipeline for Evolutionary Biology Models</h3>
                        <p>Developed a robust computational pipeline using Python to integrate and analyze over 3000 genetic sequencing data points. This project aimed to parameterize and infer process-based models in evolutionary biology. The pipeline facilitated stable data integration and improved the accuracy of computational and mathematical models. Key techniques included conventional statistical methods, differential equations, and agent-based modeling. The project significantly enhanced the understanding of system behavior in evolutionary biology applications.</p>

                        <h3>Analyzing Employee Retention: A Bayesian Approach to Tenure Data</h3>
                        <p>Aimed to analyze employee tenure data to determine the average length of time employees stay at a company. Utilizing Bayesian methods and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations, the project involved developing a computational pipeline to integrate and analyze tenure data for 14,999 employees. The analysis provided insights into the mean tenure and the probability that the average tenure exceeds two years. Key techniques included statistical evaluations, normal distribution modeling, and the Random Walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. This project significantly contributed to understanding employee retention patterns and informed strategic decisions for improving workforce stability.</p>

                        <h3>Linguistic Analysis of Clicks in Bilingual Speakers: A Study on Discourse Markers and Fillers</h3>
                        <p> This project investigates the use of clicks as discourse markers or fillers in bilingual speakers, focusing on their functions and frequency. Clicks, often produced unconsciously, serve various roles similar to 'uh' or 'uhm' in speech. Previous research has identified clicks as markers for searching or pausing before speaking.

                            In this study, we analyzed a corpus of interviews with 36 bilingual speakers from Texas, considering variables such as age, gender, place of birth (U.S. or Mexico), level and use of Spanish, and education. Our research aims to determine whether these variables influence the frequency, function, and placement of clicks.
                            
                            We hypothesized that:
                            
                            There will be no statistically significant difference in the ratio of words per click based on gender, age, place of birth, domain, speaking ability, and education.
                            There will be no statistically significant difference in the functions of clicks based on these variables.
                            There will be no statistically significant difference in the placement of clicks based on these variables.
                            This study contributes to the understanding of clicks from a linguistic perspective, highlighting their idiosyncratic nature and exploring their role in bilingual communication.</p>

                    <h3>Strategic Real Estate Investment Analysis and Recommendations</h3>
                    <p>In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the U.S. real estate market to identify optimal investment opportunities for a $12 million investment. The focus was on single-family homes and rental apartments, with the goal of purchasing properties, upgrading them, and then either renting or selling them for maximum profit.

                        The analysis included:
                        
                        Market Trends: Evaluated current market trends to identify the best-performing real estate markets in the U.S. Key markets identified for high growth included Detroit, MI, Richmond, VA, and Cleveland, OH.
                        Sale Prices and Inventory: Assessed whether sale prices and inventory listings were increasing or decreasing across the U.S. The findings indicated a year-over-year increase in both home prices and inventory.
                        Investment Timing: Determined the optimal timing for investment, recommending immediate investment in high-growth areas to capitalize on current market conditions.
                        Time on Market: Analyzed the average duration properties stay on the market before being rented or sold, which was approximately 61 days.
                        Expected Profit from Sales: Calculated the expected return on investment (ROI) from property sales after upgrades, with an example ROI of 25%.
                        Expected Monthly Income from Rentals: Estimated the average monthly income from rentals after upgrades, mortgage payments, and taxes, with an example ROI of 2%.
                        This project provided strategic recommendations for real estate investments, highlighting the potential for significant returns through careful market selection and property management. The analysis and insights gained from this project are instrumental in making informed investment decisions in the real estate market.</p>
